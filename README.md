# SecretDiary
This is a webpage in which a user can create an account that allows them to enter their personal thoughts and use as a diary. The diary updates in real time without the user having to worry to press a save button. The user is also kept logged in until they log out; so they can travel to other pages and when they comeback they will be redirected to exactly where they were in their diary.
